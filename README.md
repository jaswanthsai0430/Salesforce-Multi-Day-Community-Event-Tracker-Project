Problem Statement 

Coordinating multi-day community events (such as college fests or hackathons) is complex, 
with overlapping sessions, volunteer needs, personalized registration, and a demand for 
real-time attendance tracking. 

Current Pain Point 

 ‚Ä¢ Event details scattered across spreadsheets, chat groups, and emails. 

 ‚Ä¢ Hard to personalize and manage attendee schedules. 

 ‚Ä¢ Manual volunteer scheduling leads to gaps/overlaps. 

 ‚Ä¢ No live tracking of session attendance or volunteer contribution. 

 ‚Ä¢ Feedback and analytics are slow and fragmented. 

The organization needs a Salesforce CRM solution to: 

 ‚Ä¢ Centralize all event, session, and attendee data.

  ‚Ä¢ Automate registration, check-in, and feedback collection.

 ‚Ä¢ Provide personalized schedules to attendees, volunteers, and speakers. 

 ‚Ä¢ Offer real-time dashboards for attendance, engagement, and volunteer activity. 

 ‚Ä¢ Improve post-event reporting and engagement follow-up.
